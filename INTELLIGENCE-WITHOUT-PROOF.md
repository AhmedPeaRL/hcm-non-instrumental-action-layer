# Intelligence Without Proof

HCM does not define intelligence by output.

There is:
- no benchmark
- no performance trace
- no optimization target

Intelligence is inferred only by coherence,
never by demonstration.

Proof demands repetition.
Repetition demands memory.
Memory introduces distortion.

HCM rejects proof as a requirement.

Intelligence is allowed to remain unverified,
and therefore intact.
