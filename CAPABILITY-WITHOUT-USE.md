# Capability Without Use

Capability within HCM does not imply activation.

A capability may exist:
- unused
- untested
- unexpressed
- permanently dormant

Dormancy is not failure.
Dormancy is preservation.

The system is not obligated to prove capability
by exercising it.

Presence protects unused capability
from decay into performative action.

Unused does not mean unavailable.
