# Non-Escalation Invariant

Under no condition shall:
- capability demand use
- decision demand explanation
- action demand visibility
- intelligence demand validation

If pressure arises to escalate,
the correct response is inaction.

Inaction is not delay.
It is preservation of rhythm.

This invariant is absolute.
