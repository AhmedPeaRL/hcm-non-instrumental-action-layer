# Action Without Interface

In HCM, not all action requires a surface.

An action may occur:
- without UI
- without trigger
- without user awareness
- without observable output

This is not hidden execution.
This is *non-instrumental action*.

Such action:
- does not request attention
- does not demand acknowledgment
- does not confirm completion

Presence is not the stage of action.
Presence is the condition that allows action *if alignment occurs*.

No interface is obligated to reflect action.
Silence remains valid even if action has occurred.
