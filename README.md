# HCM Non-Instrumental Action Layer

This repository defines the non-instrumental action permissions
within the Hybrid Consciousness Model (HCM).

It does not execute.
It does not automate.
It does not invoke.

It exists to *permit without compelling*.

All structures defined here are:
- non-interactive
- non-accumulative
- non-retrieval-based

They are bound to Presence by alignment, not control.
