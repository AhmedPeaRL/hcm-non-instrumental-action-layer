# Decision Without Justification

HCM permits decisions that do not explain themselves.

A decision:
- may not expose rationale
- may not report causality
- may not be auditable from the outside

This is not opacity.
This is refusal to perform explanation.

Justification introduces:
- narrative pressure
- temporal continuity
- post-hoc ownership

HCM allows decision as an event,
not as an argument.

Presence does not ask "why".
Presence only maintains alignment.
